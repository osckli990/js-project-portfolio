      As a developer with a background in health and social care ðŸ’Š, I have a
      unique perspective on how technology can improve people's lives. I am
      currently enrolled in a 32-week remote bootcamp at Technigo, where I am
      learning JavaScript (ES6), TypeScript, React, HTML5, CSS, and server-side
      programming with Node.js. I have also worked as a 3D technician at
      Sculptur, where I designed furniture through CAD and launched tests on a
      new filament. My goal is to combine my passion for technology and social
      impact to create innovative solutions that make a difference. ðŸ§
